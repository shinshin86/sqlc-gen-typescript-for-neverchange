# Browser neverchange

This is an example of using [neverchange](https://github.com/shinshin86/neverchange), a wrapper library for SQLite WASM, in sqlc-gen-typescript.

You can see how it works by starting a browser with `npm run dev`, accessing `localhost:5173` and opening the developer console of the browser.
